  <p>When you think of the world wide web do you ever think of how it came to be and what genius person<br> or persons came up with the idea? Well this article will hopefully put most of your questions and curiosity to a close.</p>
  <p>The World Wide Web was turned on so to speak in 1990 but it was actually thought up in 1989 by a British engineer<br> named Sir Tim Bernes-Lee. 1990 was the day he and a Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed to use<br> hypertext to link all of the information on the internet to others that were getting on and wanting to see it, and in<br> December that same year they publicly introduced it to the world.</p>
    <p>Bernes-Lee’s breakthrough was to combine the internet. In his book Weaving The Web he mentions many times<br> that a combination of these two breakthroughs would revolutionize the internet and all the things you could do with it,<br> when no one took him up on his suggestions he decided to do it himself, coming up with three essential technologies.<br> First, Uniformed Resource Locater (URL) and Uniformed Resource Identifier (URI), which is a system of global unique<br> identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere first called the Universal Document Identifier (UDI).<br> Second, the publishing language HyperText Markeup Language (HTML). Third, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br> The URL is a specific character string that constitutes a reference to an Internet resource, HTML is the main markup language<br> for displaying web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser, and HTTP is the foundation of data<br> communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>If some of you are old enough to remember back when the World Wide Web had just been put up<br> how it was boring with just backgrounds and letters I’m sure you remember and was thrilled when it was able to handle pictures<br> and other graphical interfaces, it made the Web so much more fun to use. This amazing turning point for the Web began with the introduction and use of the Mosaic web browser, without Mosaic graphics would not be used as much if even at all with text and other interfaces. Mosaic’s graphical user interface because of Mosaic allowed the Web to become the most popular Internet protocol.</p>
  <p>Many other websites have been created because of the fast construction of the internet and how it is able to move information from one country/town to the next with very little time involved. And because of Berners-Lee contribution of the World Wide Web it is all possible, he has played an active role in guiding the development of web standards, and in recent years has advocated his vision of a Semantic Web. And contrary to popular belief the World Wide Web is not the same as the Internet. The Web just uses the Internet to store a collection of documents and both client and server software protocols such as HTTP.</p> 
  <p>It’s kind of scary to think of this world without Internet and the World Wide Web, think of all it does for us, moving files, pictures, videos, and much other information back and forth constantly never resting, the world would be a totally different place if the World Wide Web or the Internet was never created.</p>
