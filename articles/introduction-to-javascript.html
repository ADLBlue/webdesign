  <h2>A few things you have to know before you jump in JavaScript.</h2>
  <p>There are many ways to make dynamic websites. JavaScript is one of
  them, and most websites use JavaScript. Recently web developers can use
  JavaScript as server-side script.

  <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

  <p>JavaScript is the prototype-based scripting language of the web to
	improve user-interfaces and build websites with dynamic features. For
	example, auto-fill forms, auto refresh, and so on. JavaScript is not same
	as Java even though both are based on C and C++. Java developed by Sun is a
	programming language that does totally different things, and Java is much
	harder to learn. JavaScript is developed by Brendan Eich and working at
	Netscape.</p>

  <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>

  <p>JavaScript is lightweight and has excellent
	portability. Also it interacts with the sites and works well with HTML and
	CSS.</p>

  <h3>Where JavaScript is used?</h3>

  <p>JavaScript is used on the website and also used as a server-side or
  client-side script.</p>

  <p>Server-side vs client-side. Letâ€™s talk about server and client. There
	is a restaurant. Then   you can think that customer is a client and an
	owner of the restaurant is a server. If a customer requests food, then an
	owner gives food to a customer. In this case, a customer is client side,
	and an owner is server side. On the web, clients are web browsers like
	Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer, and servers are web
	servers.</p>
