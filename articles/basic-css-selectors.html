    If you’re anything like me, CSS selectors are part of a foreign language you’ve encountered for the very first time. My mind is slowly wrapping itself around the idea of, “writing code”, something I never thought I would tackle. So learn with me to use selectors to design the HTML code that you’ve carefully written so far. Hopefully by this point you are familiar with creating basic code in HTML because it will be the basis of assigning selectors within CSS to your code document.

  <h3> What are CSS Selectors?</h3>
  <p>
  CSS enables a user to style their HTML code to add more creativity and personality to a web page. There are many types of CSS selectors but we will just focus on a few basics to start with. It assigns specific attributes to different elements within the web code. Below is how selectors will look in CSS.</p>

<pre><code style="language-css">
selector {
  property1 : value;
}
</code></pre>

<div class="Lets Create">

  <h3> Lets Create</h3>
  <p>
    Creating headlines are a good place to start to learn how CSS code affects how your web page will look. Below you can see the tag &lt;h1&gt; in HTML, this will be the selector code used in CSS to adjust how the web page headline will look.</p>
  <p>
    Now going to CSS, start with “h1” and an open curly bracket to begin assigning attributes. Font-family, color, and font-size are just a few things that can be adjusted. Don’t forget to also close with a curly bracket.</p>
  <p>
    Finally lets view the fruit of our labors so far. This is the headline of the website that I’m working on right now. My name is now assigned Futura as the font, black or #000 as the color and 50px as the font size because of the h1 selector in CSS. Font-family is called a “property” and Futura is its “value”. </p>
  <p>
    Assigning classes in HTML is another way to apply attributes to your web page to give it more pizazz. The class I’ve created is “profile.” By doing this you can easily adjust how everything within the profile class looks. For my web page the profile class adjusts my background and the spacing it allows. In HTML it looks like the image below.</p>
  <p>
    As you can see below, I’ve adjusted colors, padding sizes, and effects such as a box shadow by  using a variety of properties and values. </p>
